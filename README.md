# Seabeetpopulations
Sea beet [Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima (L.) Arcang.] populations exhibit high genetic diversity and possess valuable traits that could enhance resilience, disease resistance, and tolerance to abiotic stress.

Within this study, a total of 1,363 genotypes across three Northern Atlantic sea beet populations from Denmark, France, and Ireland were analyzed using 16,201 SNP markers.
